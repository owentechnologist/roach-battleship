''' 
This class provides the behavior of an automated player who:
1. picks a quadrant at random
2. picks a ship type at random
3. picks an anchor point at random
4. checks for collision between ship at anchor point in quadrant and ships in vector database
5. prints out result
6. sleeps for 3 seconds
